# 🏨 Hospitality Management Dashboard - Power BI Project

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive Power BI dashboard for the hospitality industry. It helps hotel managers easily track important business data like total bookings, revenue, revenue loss, and cancellation rates. The dashboard also shows when bookings are made, which channels perform best, and where losses are happening. By turning complex data into clear visuals, this dashboard makes it easier to understand business performance and make smarter, faster decisions.
